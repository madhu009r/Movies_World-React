# 🎬 MoviesWorld

MoviesWorld is a **React-based movie discovery platform** that fetches real-time data from the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to showcase **trending and popular movies**.  
This project was designed with the goal of demonstrating **frontend development skills**, **API integration**, and **client-side state persistence** using **Local Storage**.

The application offers users:
- An **interactive UI** to explore the latest movies
- Ability to **save favorites** that persist across browser sessions
- A **search function** for finding movies instantly

💡 This project is part of my **full-stack development portfolio** and reflects my ability to combine **React.js**, **API integration**, and **state management** with clean, responsive design.  
With a background in **Computer Science Engineering (Cybersecurity)**, I approach development not only with functionality in mind but also with attention to performance and user experience.
